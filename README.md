## Instructions

To run the app: fork, clone and then run 'npm install' to install all dependencies onto the directory for your clone.
Run 'npm run dev-server' from the command line and then visit localhost:8080 to use the app.
To add a todo, click the 'Add Task' button located in the top left of the screen. Please enter a task name and description
of your choosing and then add the task.

Newly added tasks are included in the first column by default. Once you start a task, it is shifted to the next column over. Finishing a task moves it to the 'completed' column. If you wish to archive a task, simply click on the 'Archive' button to
store the task away. Archived tasks currently can't be retrieved.

## Tests
There are several simple tests that ensure that the UI components are replicable. To run the tests, you can execute
the 'npm test' command in your command line.
